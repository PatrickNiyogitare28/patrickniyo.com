It provides a range of cloud services, including compute, analytics, storage and networking. 
Users can pick and choose from these services to develop and scale new applications, or run existing applications in the public cloud.

[Azure] was initially launched on February 1, 2010, It's one of the popular [cloud computing](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/cloud-computing-tutorial/what-is-cloud-computing)  platforms operationg on a large scale like

## Things to know about Azure
- It was launched on February 1, 2010, significantly later than its main competitor, AWS.
- It’s free to start and follows a pay-per-use model, which means you pay only for the services you opt for.
- Interestingly, 80 percent of the Fortune 500 companies use Azure services for their cloud computing needs.
- Azure supports multiple programming languages, including Java, Node Js, and C#.
- Another benefit of Azure is the number of data centers it has around the world. There are 42 Azure data centers spread around the globe, which is the highest number of data centers for any cloud platform. Also, Azure is planning to get 12 more data centers, which will increase the number of data centers to 54, shortly.

## What is Azure used for

Because Microsoft Azure consists of numerous service offerings, its use cases are extremely diverse. Running virtual machines or containers in the cloud is one of the most popular uses for Microsoft Azure. 
These compute resources can host infrastructure components, such as 
- domain name system (DNS) servers 
- Windows Server services -- such as Internet Information Services (IIS) or 
- third-party applications. 
Microsoft also supports the use of third-party operating systems, such as Linux.

Azure is also commonly used as a platform for hosting databases in the cloud. Microsoft offers serverless relational databases such as Azure SQL and non-relational databases such as NoSQL.

In addition, the platform is frequently used for backup and disaster recovery. Many organizations use Azure storage as archive in order to meet their long-term Data retention requirements.

That it the cool feature that leads to migrating to [Azure], let's take an example
> To day my company has an on-premises server where we host our data, It really requires much of security in the place... troubleshooting the servers when they are down, Maintainance work and fees, I need a backup and etc.

In that case I will need to migrate from on-premises to [Azure] all that work will no longer be needed,
My servers will always be able, I don't care of maintainance, no maintaince fees required and my data is very safe. I don't have to care about the backup and etc
