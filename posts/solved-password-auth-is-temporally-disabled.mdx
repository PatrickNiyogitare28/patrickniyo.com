### How to resolve

Let's see how you can quickly get this resolved in the simplest way so that you can keep working.

- [x] [Create your github access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
- [x] Update the 
    ```shell
    $ git remote origin url
    ``` 
    to use token 
 
Feel free to jump that  step **creating access token** if you have already created your github access token
  > Note that you don't need to create a new access token for each project, It will depend on previlages you need to include in the access token

1. Remove remote origin 
    ```shell
    $ git remote remove origin
    ```
2. Reset the remote origin including ***your token you created***
    ```shell
    $ git remote add origin https://<token>@<git_url>.git
    ```
    
Now you are good to go
