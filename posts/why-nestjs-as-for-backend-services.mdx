### What is Nestjs

[Nestjs] is a framework for building efficient, scalable [Nodejs] server-side applications. It uses modern JavaScript, is built with [TypeScript] (preserves compatibility with pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

Under the hood, Nest makes use of [Express], but also, provides compatibility with a wide range of other libraries, like e.g. [Fastify], allowing for easy use of the myriad third-party plugins which are available.

It uses robust HTTP Server frameworks like [Express] or [Fastify]. Nest provides a level of abstraction above the common Node.js frameworks and exposes their APIs to the developer. This gives a great amount of freedom to use third-party modules.

It is the fastest growing nodejs typescript framework for building server side interprise application. It was develope by [Kamil Mysliwiec] and the first version was released in 2017 highly inspired by [Angular].

### Why nestjs

To be able to talk about the nestjs magics you always need to bring in Nodejs because [Nestjs] adds a layour abover the usual [Express] or [Fastify] application.
In nodejs ecosystem Nodejs includes nothing by default there is no assumption.
If would like to know why I'm talking about [Nestjs] and why It's the first [Nodejs] framework highly used today, I found you minimal points in very many others.

- [x] Developer is tasked project setup for every thing needed to be used, architecture set up which may
      result into the potential problems as the application grows or the team grows very large, the application is hard to maintain and lack of consistance in the codebase

- [x] [Nestjs] provides those setup such as setting up [TypeScript], api routing, middleware setup, error handling, E2E tests and Unite tests etc

- [x] [Nestjs] provides developer teams with out of the box architecture to create scalable, loosly-coupled, testable
      and maintainable interprise applications.

- [x] [Nestjs] being amaizing it doesn't block a developer from using the basic [Nodejs] but it adds a layer above [Nodejs],
      by default it uses express but upon that you can also use fastfy or other

- [x] A quick and efficient development process, architecture consistance, [TypeScript] and Robust CLI accelerates the development process

- [x] Highly scalable and easy to maintain applications.

- [x] It's Opensource and Fastest growing [Nodejs] framework for the past 3 years with Large and active community, you can join the community [discord server](https://discord.gg/qF6dWNQH). For any blocker or issue you post and get replied soon from community members

- [x] [Nestjs] has positioned itself at a unique crossroad of front end and mid-tier development that many languages have struggled to find.

- [x] The use of TypeScript helps ensure that Nest will remain relevant in the rapidly changing JavaScript landscape and gives developers less context switching.

- [x] Support for dozens of nest-specific modules that help you easily integrate with common technologies and concepts like TypeORM, Mongoose, GraphQL, Logging, Validation, Caching, WebSockets and much more

- [x] The passport feature that allows easy intergration of thirdy part authentication strategies e.g: Auth0, Github Auth, Facebook Auth, OAuth2 etc

- [x] It leverages [TypeScript] — strongly typed language which is a superset of [JavaScript]

- [x] Great documentation for guidance

- [x] Easy E2E and Unite tests, [Nestjs] powerfull CLI generates `.spec` file for `controller`, `service`, `gateway` and etc with boiler plate code to build the feature Unite tests, you can also override them or intergrate other third party testing libraries.

- [x] Built for large scale and maintainable enterprise applications, [Nestjs] is breaking the record of [Java] known of building large scale interprise applications, with [Nestjs] you can build them and keep the [Java] desplines such as **OOP** and **Dependency Injection**

- [x] Like it was mentioned above in introductions, [Nestjs] provides an out of the box application architecture that allows developers and teams to create highly testable, scalable, loosely coupled and easily maintainable applications.

- [x] [Nestjs] forces developers to use a specific architecture by introducing [Angular] -like modules, services, and controllers, ensuring the application is scalable, highly testable, and loosely coupled contrary to other [Nodejs] frameworks like [Express], [Fastify] or Koa where a mistake early on in the project regarding the architecture may cost a lot in terms of time spent refactoring the codebase later.

- [x] The structure of the application in [Nestjs] is heavily based on [Angular]. The structure is very simple and allows more attention to be paid to the design of endpoints and their consumers, instead of the application structure.

- [x] Powerful Command Line Interface (CLI) to boost productivity and ease of development

- [x] [Nestjs] swagger for Restful API documation easy the work of documenting apis

- [x] [Nestjs] is easy to learn and muster.

### What you can build with Nestjs

Nestjs provides dependincies to build a production ready application of the following

- RESTFUL API applications
- MOCROSERVICE applications
- MONOLITHIS applications
- WEB SOCKETS applications
- GRAPHQL applications
- CLI applications
- MVC applications
- Clone Jobs applications

### Companies using Nestjs

Knowing that serveral companies have shifted their interprise applications to [Nestjs] this confirms what said above
